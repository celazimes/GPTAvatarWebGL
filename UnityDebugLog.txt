7/22/2024 3:42:48 PM: Received reply: The British Shorthair is a compact, well-balanced, and powerful breed, recognized for its short, very dense coat with a crisp texture. They have a round head with large, round eyes set wide apart, adding to their distinctive look. This breed is known for its calm and easygoing nature and can take 3-5 years to reach full maturity【4:0†source】.
